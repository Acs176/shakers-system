# Payments & Payouts

Shakers uses an escrow system to protect both clients and freelancers.

## Payment Flow
1. Client funds a milestone.
2. Funds are held securely in escrow.
3. Freelancer submits work.
4. Client approves milestone → funds released.

## Notes
- Refunds are possible before milestone approval.
- Payouts to freelancers are processed within 3–5 business days.
