# Intelligent Technical Support System (Case Study)

This project implements an intelligent technical support system with personalized recommendations for the **Shakers** platform.  
It includes:
- A **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) query service** for answering user questions from a knowledge base.
- A **personalized recommendation service** that suggests relevant resources based on user history.

## Getting Started

1. Create a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. I DO NOT INCLUDE MY VENV due to large files and it's in general a bad practice.
Creating a virtual environment and installing the dependencies takes around 2 minutes:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```
2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Build the vector store

The documents are stored in the /kb folder, you just need to indicate the path where the index will end up (I used "/rag_index" as default in the rest of the code).
```bash
python -m src.app.data_ingestor.build_index_script ./kb ./index_output_path
```

4. Run the Application
```bash
python -m src.main
```
